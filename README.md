Use the SpatialOS Unity SDK to create games with persistent online worlds.
Together with the SpatialOS [spatial CLI](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/spatial-cli-introduction), the SpatialOS Unity SDK
allows you to use [Unity](https://www.unity3d.com) to create games for the [SpatialOS](https://improbable.io/games) platform.
To help you get started, there are [tutorials](docs/tutorials/learning-resources.md) to follow and [example games](docs/repositories.md) to
experiment with.  In addition to the [SpatialOS Unity SDK documentation](docs/start-here-table-of-contents.md) in this repository,  you can find out more about
SpatialOS at [docs.improbable.io](https://docs.improbable.io).
